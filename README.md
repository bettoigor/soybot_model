# soybot_model
Model of Soybot robot.

## Intalling the model
Previouly, download the gazebo models from <https://github.com/bettoigor/gazebo_models.git>.
Clone this repo to the ros catkin workspace and run ```catkin_make``` commando  to compile the package.

## Running the model
The model can be launched from the launch file ```soybot_model.launch```, using the following command:
```
roslaunch soybot_model soybot_model.launch
```
Before this, Gazebo will be launched and the simulation environment will appear.

## Checking the Environment
### Checking the published topics
To check all the topics type:
```
rostopic list
```

### Send control commands to the robot
The robot is controlled using the topic cmd_vel, that can be tested using the following command:
```
rostopic pub -1 /soybot/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: -0.0"
```
where x and z are the linear and angular velocities, respectively.

### Show image
It is possible to see the images generated by the simulator using ros image view:
```
rosrun image_view image_view image:=image_topic
```
where ```image_topic``` is the desired topic.
